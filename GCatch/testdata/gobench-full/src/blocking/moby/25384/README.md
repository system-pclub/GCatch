## Description

Some description from developers or pervious reseachers

> When n=1 (len(pm.plugins)), the location of group.Wait() doesnâ€™t matter.
  When n is larger than 1, group.Wait() is invoked in each iteration. Whenever
  group.Wait() is invoked, it waits for group.Done() to be executed n times.
  However, group.Done() is only executed once in one iteration.

Misuse of sync.WaitGroup
