In order to use Z3 MSF plugin, follow the following steps:
1. Compile latest Z3 .NET API (from any branch consisting of opt features) and copy 'libz3.dll' and 'Microsoft.Z3.dll' to the folder of 'Z3MSFPlugin.sln'.
2. Retrieve 'Microsoft.Solver.Foundation.dll' from http://archive.msdn.microsoft.com/solverfoundation/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=1799,
   preferably using DLL only version. Copy 'Microsoft.Solver.Foundation.dll' to the folder of 'Z3MSFPlugin.sln'
3. Build 'Z3MSFPlugin.sln'. Note that you have to compile using x86 target for Microsoft.Z3.dll 32-bit and x64 target for Microsoft.Z3.dll 64-bit.

The solution consists of a plugin project, a test project with a few simple test cases and a command line projects for external OML, MPS and SMPS models.
To retrieve SMT2 models which are native to Z3, set the logging file in corresponding directives or solver params e.g.

   var p = new Z3MILPParams();
   p.SMT2LogFile = "model.smt2";

For more details, check out the commands in 'Validator\Program.cs'.

Enjoy!
